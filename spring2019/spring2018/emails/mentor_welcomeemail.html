					Hello T9Hacks Mentor!
				</p>
				<p>
					Thank you for mentoring at T9Hacks 2018. We are excited to have you join us for our third annual hackathon! Mentor are a key part of the hackathon experience, especially at a beginner hackathon like T9Hacks.
				</p>
				<p>
					As T9Hacks approaches, we wanted to keep you informed about the hackathon and give you information to help you prepare for the event.

				<h2>Schedule</h2>
				<p>
					<b>The whole event</b> will run from Saturday, February 10, 2018 at 10:00 AM (MST) &ndash; Sunday, February 11, 2018 at 3:30 PM (MST)
				</p>
				<p>
					Here are some important times:
					
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span>&#10084;</span><b>Opening Ceremonies</b> &mdash; 10:30am &ndash; 11am, Saturday, February 10</li>
					<li><span>&#10084;</span><b>Hacking</b> &mdash; 12pm (noon) Saturday, February 10 &ndash; 12pm (noon) Sunday, February 11</li>
					<li><span>&#10084;</span><b>Technical Workshops</b> &mdash; 12pm (noon) &ndash; 5pm, Saturday, February 10</li>
					<li><span>&#10084;</span><b>Demos</b> &mdash; 12:30pm &ndash; 2:30pm, Sunday, February 11</li>
					<li><span>&#10084;</span><b>Judging</b> &mdash; 2:30pm &ndash; 3:00pm, Sunday, February 11</li>
					<li><span>&#10084;</span><b>Closing Ceremonies</b> &mdash; 3pm &ndash; 3:30pm, Sunday, February 11</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Mentors are welcome during the entire event. However, we need mentors during the hacking period and would be the most help a little after hacking begins (~2pm). This gives the participants some time to settle in, decide on a project, and start working before they run into problems need help from mentors.

				<h2>FAQ</h2>
				<p>
					&#10084; <b>As a mentor what will I be doing?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					T9Hackers will have 24 hours to complete a project, any type of project they wish. Any advice, suggestions, and positive feedback will benefit students significantly.
				</p>
				<p>
					Students will be working individually, or in teams up to 4 people. You may want to dedicate your time assisting one team; however, you are free to roam the event and help others.
				</p>
				<p>
					We'll be using Slack to communicate with participants, mentors, and our team.  We've set up the #mentor_help channel for mentoring help and we're telling the participants to direct their questions there.
				</p>

				</p>
				<p>
					&#10084; <b>When should I arrive?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Hacking goes from noon on Saturday to noon on Sunday. Mentors are welcome during the entire event, which starts with check-in on Saturday at 10am and ends with the end of Closing Ceremonies at 3:30pm on Sunday. However, mentors will be of most help assisting the participants with their projects during the hacking time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since many of the participants will be beginners, most of the teams will spend the start of the hackathon attending workshops or thinking of a project idea and setting up their project. We anticipate that there will be the most questions once teams solidify their projects ideas and start on their projects, around 2pm.
				</p>
				<p>
					&#10084; <b>How long do I have to stay?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					We ask that mentors stay for at least 2 hours.
				</p>
				<p>
					&#10084; <b>What should I bring?</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Bring a laptop, laptop charger, business cards (optional), and your enthusiasm!
