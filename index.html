				On Dec 14th, the FCC voted to obliterate net neutrality rules, letting Internet providers like Verizon and Comcast control what we can see and do online.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is nothing to stop Internet Service Providers from charging us extra fees to access the online content we want -- or throttling, blocking, and censoring websites and apps.
			</p>
			<p>
				This affects every every Internet user and we can still get Congress to stop this—by passing a "Resolution of Disapproval" to overturn the FCC vote. We can win. Write and call Congress now!
			</p>

				Please, take a moment of your time to <a href=https://www.battleforthenet.com/breaktheinternet/ class="nnbtn" target="_blank">join the protest</a> and <a href=https://www.battleforthenet.com class="nnbtn" target="_blank">contact Congress</a> to fight for net neutrality.

					<h2>About</h2>
					
					<p>
						T9Hacks is a 24-hour women's hackathon held on February 10-11, held in the ATLAS Institute on the University of Colorado Boulder's campus.  
					</p>
					<p>
						Our goal is to create fun and creative environments where students can learn and solve compelling problems.  
					</p>
					<p>
						The 2018 hackathon will have three tracks students can participate in: Creative Technology, Humanitarian Technology, and Cybersecurity.  We'll have workshops and design challenges for each of these tracks that are aimed at introducing students to these topics, teaching them the tools that are used to build solutions, and exploring the complexities that each topic has to offer.
					</p>
					
					<h3>Creative Technology</h3>
					<p>
						We encourage students to build projects in areas such as graphic design, data visualization, 3D modeling, simulation, game design, motion graphics, animation, video, narrative media, robotics, physical computing, the Internet of Things, interactive environment design, experience design, digital sound, web design and development, mobile application design and user-experience/user-interface.
					</p>
					
					<h3>Humanitarian Technology</h3>
					<p>
						These projects involve leveraging technology to address human need.  Projects in this track must achieve a balance between technology and societal need.  The best solutions involve teams of technologists, social scientists, development practitioners, entrepreneurs, and many others to see all sides of a problem and create a solution that that is innovative and useful to the community in need. 
					</p>
					
					<h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
					<p>
						Coming Soon!

					<h2>Registration</h2>
					
					<h3>Participants, Hackers, Students</h3>
					<a href="https://cuboulder.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_40D5u59385n3OYt" target="_blank" class="btn btnBig">Register</a>
					<p>
						To attend T9Hacks, it is required that people register.  This allows us to better plan and lets us host a better event for everyone. This is also a registration process, not an application, once you sign-up, we assume you're coming!
					</p>
					
					<h3>Mentors</h3>
					<a href="https://cuboulder.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3qkKLWkdJlhjfZb" target="_blank" class="btn btnBig">Sign Up</a>
					<p><b>Mentors are key to the hackathon experience.</b> Hackathons are a space for exploration and learning, often in an area that participants may not be familiar with.  Many of our participants may need help getting started or will have questions about technology that is unfamiliar to them.  This is where mentors come in!  We need your expertise and help to guide T9Hackers as they work on their projects.  Mentors create their own schedule and we only ask that you come for at least 2 hours.  Sign up to be a mentor below!</p>

					<h3>Volunteers</h3>
					<a href="https://cuboulder.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6rrkRrQxKgREucR" target="_blank" class="btn btnBig">Sign Up</a>
					<p><b>Volunteers the backbone of a hackathon!</b>  T9Hacks has a small team and we need extra help to keep the hackathon running smoothly.  Jobs can range from helping to set up tables or assisting with hardware check-out.  Volunteering isn't a full-time job and participants can be volunteers too!  Volunteering also counts toward community service or volunteer hours that scholarships may require.  Sign up to be a volunteer below!</p>

					<h2>FAQ</h2>
					
					<div class="column6">
						
						<div class="sectionShadowBox">
							<h3>What is T9Hacks?</h3>
							<p>
								We're a 24-hour making and building marathon event. We are a hackathon but prefer to call ourselves a make-a-thon.  Our participants come to T9Hacks to learn and be creative in a welcoming environment. 
							</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="sectionShadowBox">
							<h3>What is hacking?</h3>
							<p>
								"Hacking" doesn't mean malicious programming or breaking into something. We want you to "hack" (design, build, create, MacGyver) technology, art, and media together to create something awesome.
							</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="sectionShadowBox">
							<h3>Who can come?</h3>
							<p>
								T9Hacks is for college students (and recent college grads) to discover what hackathons are and to learn, explore, and create something new.
							</p>
							<p>
								T9Hacks is a technical hackathon in theme only.  We encourage anyone, no matter you're skill level, with an interest or enthusiasm for technology and computing to come.
							</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="sectionShadowBox">
							<h3>How much experience do I have to have?</h3>
							<p>
								At T9Hacks it doesn't matter if you've never written a line of code, we still want you to come.  We encourage women from all backgrounds to participate. It doesn't matter whether you are an art, journalism, computer science, or marketing major—there is a place for you here.
							</p>
							<p>
								We will be hosting workshops for beginners and intermediate programmers, with the goal of providing support and mentoring for our participants to learn.  
							</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="sectionShadowBox">
							<h3>So at this hackathon, what will happen?</h3>
							<p>
								Students will create brand-new projects.  We want you to be creative, learn something new, and explore the possibilities.  Get a start on a project you've had in the back of your mind.  Create a solution to a problem you see a lot.  Develop your skills in your area.  Try out a new technology or software.  Create something new.
							</p>
							<p>
								Remember to bring your laptop, phone, chargers, change of clothes, and a well-rested open mind.  But the most essential thing to bring is your creativity!
							</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="sectionShadowBox">
							<h3>If it's a women's hackathon, can men come?</h3>
							<p>
								T9Hacks was created to support women and gender minority students. We call ourselves a women's hackathon because it succinctly sums up our gender-driven mission and goals. T9Hacks is open to students of every gender, including trans-and-cis-male allies, but we especially encourage women, non-binary, gender-nonconforming, and transgender students to come.
							</p>
						</div>
						
					</div>
					
					
					<div class="column6">
						
						<div class="sectionShadowBox">
							<h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
							<p>
								Participation is completely free! We will provide food, snacks, and drinks to energize you throughout the event. We ask that everyone register before they arrive at the event.
							</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="sectionShadowBox">
							<h3>Do we work individually or in teams?</h3>
							<p>
								We encourage people to work in teams of 4.  24 hours isn't a long time to create a project, so teammates can help an idea along.  This is a great place to meet new women with different skillsets. You can come with a pre-formed group and idea, an idea of your own and no team, or a desire to help someone else's idea along. If you don't have a team or an idea, we'll host an icebreaker event before the hackathon for everyone to meet and share ideas.
							</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="sectionShadowBox">
							<h3>How long is the event?</h3>
							<p>
								T9Hacks is a 24-hour hackathon.  This means hacking will go for 24 hours straight.  It sounds like a long time, but it goes quickly when you are collaborating, planning, and creating projects.  We'll have opening and closing ceremonies before and after hacking.  For more details, scroll down for the complete event schedule.
							</p>

							<h3>How do I get there?</h3>
							<p>
								CU has a great public transit system! There are local RTD busses that drop off directly in front of the ATLAS building and many more regional busses that drop off at CU. For more information about the bus system, you can visit
								<a href="http://www.colorado.edu/pts/node/265" target="_blank">CU's Public Transit Page</a>
								or the
								<a href="http://www.rtd-denver.com/" target="_blank">RTD website</a>.
								If you are unsure of what bus to take, Google Maps is a great way
								to plan your trip!

							</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="sectionShadowBox">
							<h3>Do you have travel reimbursements?</h3>
							<p>
								If you get yourself to T9, we will provide the rest! We encourage all to come to T9Hacks, but due to our hackathon's small size, we are unable to cover or reimburse any travel costs.
							</p> 
						</div>
						
						<div class="sectionShadowBox">
							<h3>If I have more questions, who can I contact?</h3>
							<p>
								Major League Hacking (MLH) has some hacking resources on their website: <a href="https://mlh.io/faq" target="blank">MLH FAQ</a>. Or you can email the lead coordinator, Brittany, at Brittany.Kos [at] colorado.edu

					<h2>Inclusion</h2>

					<h3>Mission</h3>
					<p>
						The mission of T9Hacks is to create a welcoming and safe place for women and marginalized students to explore hackathons.  Our goal is to create opportunity for newcomers to explore a hackathon environment while learning and solving compelling problems.  T9Hacks works towards this mission by creating women, gender equality, creative technology, beginner, and other similar types of hackathons that support women and marginalized students.  T9hacks is open to everyone and values all dimensions of gender identity.
					</p>
					
					<h3>What does T9Hacks stand for?</h3>
					<p>
						T9 stands for Title IX, the ninth title of the United States Education Amendments of 1972 which states:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						T9Hacks believes everyone deserves to learn.  We are here to help make that happen.</p>
					</p>
					
					<h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
					<p>
						At T9Hacks, we believe in creating a safe and welcoming environment for everyone.  Everyone involved at our events&mdash;from the organizers to the participants&mdash;follow the <a href="https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf">MLH Code of Conduct</a>.
