					<h2>About</h2>
					
					<p>
						Our goal is to create fun and creative environments where students can learn and solve compelling problems.  
					</p>
					<p>
						The 2018 hackathon will have two tracks students can participate in: Creative Technology and Humanitarian Technology.  We'll have workshops and design challenges for each of these tracks that are aimed at introducing students to these topics, teaching them the tools that are used to build solutions, and exploring the complexities that each topic has to offer.
					</p>
					
					<h3>Creative Technology</h3>
					<p>
						We encourage students to build projects in areas such as graphic design, data visualization, 3D modeling, simulation, game design, motion graphics, animation, video, narrative media, robotics, physical computing, the Internet of Things, interactive environment design, experience design, digital sound, web design and development, mobile application design and user-experience/user-interface.
					</p>
					
					<h3>Humanitarian Technology</h3>
					<p>
						These projects involve leveraging technology to address human need.  Projects in this track must achieve a balance between technology and societal need.  The best solutions involve teams of technologists, social scientists, development practitioners, entrepreneurs, and many others to see all sides of a problem and create a solution that that is innovative and useful to the community in need.
